## stack-aarch64-static

*This project is deprecated now, since upstream started [building static binary for aarch64](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/pull/6212).*

This repo builds statically linked aarch64 (arm64) binary for [stack](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack/) releases.
